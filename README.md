   ```

2. Create Facebook application at https://developers.facebook.com/apps/

   - "Website with Facebook Login" must be checked, but for "Site URL", you can enter any landing URL.

Strategy configuration
----------------------

Required parameters:

```php
<?php
'Facebook' => array(
	'app_id' => 'YOUR APP ID',
	'app_secret' => 'YOUR APP SECRET'
)
```

Even though `scope` is an optional configuration parameter for Opauth-Facebook, for most cases you would like to explicitly define it. It should be defined in a comma-separated string. 

Refer to [Facebook Permissions Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/) for list of valid permissions..
